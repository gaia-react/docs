## Background

GAIA React is the spiritual successor to the GAIA Flash Framework, which was the most popular Flash framework in the world. It was used to build over 100,000 Flash sites and relied upon by every major digital agency worldwide. GAIA was known for its comprehensive feature set, ease of use, and robustness. It was designed to make Flash development easier and more efficient, and it succeeded in that goal.

GAIA React has been in development for over 3 years, with multiple developers on different teams contributing to its development. It has been used in production on multiple projects, and has been refined and improved over time.


## Why GAIA?

Back in the Flash days, almost all projects were greenfield, and Flash engineers had many opportunities every year to build projects from scratch. This gave us a lot of practice learning the hard way what worked and what didn't. We got to experiment with design patterns. We didn't have npm, we had to build everything ourselves. And we got to do it over and over again.

Nowadays, there are very few opportunities for engineers to practice and learn from building greenfield projects. Most projects are maintenance projects, where you're working on someone else's code, and your ability to make fundamental changes can be limited. In the worst cases, the main thing you're learning is how to cope with a code base that has too much tech debt.

GAIA React is the culmination of years of experience building greenfield projects. It is a great way to learn best practices, and to see how a modern React project should be structured and organized.

## Philosophy

A big part of GAIA is its robust linting and testing setup. We believe that the best way to work on a team or together and produce cohesive well-written, easy-to-read and easy-to-maintain code. GAIA's linting has fix-on-save functionality that automatically takes care of things so you and your fellow developers can focus on what really matters.

Following [Prettier's philosophy](https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier), GAIA comes with automatic code formatting and styling, with best-practice linting rules which keep code clean and consistent across your entire team.

The entire linting setup is included in the project folder, for you to customize to your liking. Detailed information about the linting setup can be found in the [Code Quality](/tech-stack/code-quality) section.

## Component-Driven Development

Storybook is included with GAIA. It's a great way to develop components in isolation, to see how they look and behave in different states, and to test them to make sure they work as expected in all those different states.
